// Explanation:

isAnagram takes two string parameters a and b, and starts by declaring boolean
"anagram". This boolean represents whether or not the two strings a and b are
anagrams. The method checks if they are of the same length and if they are, puts
each string into their own charArray, then compares them with .equals. If they
are the same, the program prints out "true", if not then "false", as the
instructions state. isRotation also takes two string parameters a and b, and declares boolean
rotation and string temp (for temporary). It then checks if the two strings are
of the same length and if they are, stores the first string twice in the temp
string, then checks if the second string is in "temp".
